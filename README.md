# DOM-exercise-1

This is an exercise from the bootcamp at Grand Circus.

The directions included:
1. creating a function named main() that has an onclick property on a button element.
2. adding the "big" class to the element of id="grow-me" which will allow the text to get bigger when the main() function is run.
3. removing the "big" class from the element with id="shrink-me" so text will shrink when main() is ran.
4. logging the inner text from the list items into the console.
5. using setAttribute to change the link from one address to a new one.
6. changing the text of the link using innertext
7. changing css properties through javascript using .style to change display to "none" and another element's display to "block"
8. using the value from the user's text enetered into the input element to diplay "Welcome (user name)" in the heading
